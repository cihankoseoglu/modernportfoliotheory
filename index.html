					<h3>The role of risk</h3>

					<section>
					<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">Efficient-market hypothesis</a> explains why random walk is possible</p>
					<p class="fragment">Stock market is incredible in adjusting to new information - no one can predict its <em>exact</em> future course </p>
					<p class="fragment">Your guess is as good as an ape, a stockbroker, or even Carl Icahn</p></section>

					<section>
					<p>Academics says the way to beat the market is not to exercise superior clairvoyance</p>
					<p class="fragment">but to assume greater risk, because risk alone determines the degree of returns.</p>
					
					</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What is risk?</h3>

					<section>
						<p>"The possibility of suffering harm or loss"</p>
						<p class="fragment">One-year Treasury bills, yields 2 percent and hold them until they mature</p>
						<p class="fragment">Common stock in my local electric utility for one year, anticipating a 5 percent dividend.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Investment risk: The chance that expected security returns will not materialize, and in particular, will fall in price.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Financial risk has generally been defined as the variance or standard deviation of returns</p>
						<p class="fragment">A security, whose returns are not likely to depart much from its expected return has little risk.</p>
						<p class="fragment">A security, whose returns from year to year are quite volatile, has higher risk.</p>

					<p>Conjured in 1950s by Harry Markowitz</p>
					<p class="fragment">The math behind is complex.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Risky portfolios can be put together in such a way that the portfolio as a whole could be less risky than the individual stocks in it.</p>

				<section>
					<p>Now suppose instead of buying only one security, he diversifies and puts half of his money(1$) in the umbrella manufacturer and half of his money(1$) on the resort.</p>
				</section>
				

				<section>
					<p>In sunny seasons, one dollar investment returns 50 cents from the resort and loses 25 cents from the umbrella business.</p>

					<p>In rainy seasons, the opposite happens, and you get 12.5% on average.</p>

					<h3>So what has changed?</h3>

				<section>
					<p>We eliminated the risk of weather</p>
					<p class="fragment">Our expected returns are hypothesized with the premise of exactly 6 months of sun and 6 months of rain.</p>
					<p class="fragment">The reality would be quite different.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Negative covariance</p>
					<p class="fragment">As long as there is some lack of paralellism in individual companies, we can reduce risk with diversification</p>
					<p class="fragment">With perfect negative relationship (one company does perfect when the other does very bad) diversification can totally eliminate risk.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Of course it's not this easy.</p>
					<p class="fragment">There may be a recession and people may not buy vacations or umbrellas.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Perfect negative relationship is almost nonexistent.</p>

					<h2>The lesson to learn</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>If you buy Ford Motor Co. and its major supplier of tires in a stock portfolio, this diversification may not help you that much.</p>
					<p class="fragment">If Ford's sales go bad, Ford won't buy that many tires, so the supplier goes bad.</p>
					<p class="fragment">High covariance/High correlation</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>If you buy Ford Motor Co. and a government contractor in a depressed area, diversification may help.</p>
					<p class="fragment">If consumer spending is down, Ford's sales will be down and unemployment will be up.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Government tend to give out contracts to depressed areas in times of high unemployment</p>

					<blockquote>Can there be too much of a good thing? - William Shakespeare</blockquote>

					<p class="fragment">Is this really really magical?</p>
					<p class="fragment">Nope.</p>
				</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Buying only US stocks reduces the risk 60%</p>
					<p class="fragment">Buying international stock reduces it even more (because of more diverse portfolios)</p>
					<p class="fragment">However after a certain point, it converges into a single risk value.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>You have to recognize that the world has changed considerably since Markowitz first put his theory in writing.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Not every economy reacts the same way.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Oil price increase</p>
					<p class="fragment">Bad for Europe, Japan, even US</p>
					<p class="fragment">Not really bad for the Middle East</p>
					<p  class="fragment">S&P 500 Index and Morgan Stanley EAFE(Europe, Australasia and Far East) Index of developed foreign countries</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="photos/stock5.png" style="width:600px;">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>Overall portfolio risk is reduced by the addition of a small amount of riskier foreign securities.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Good returns from Japanese automakers balance the poor returns of US automakers</p>
					<p class="fragment">Dollar balances out the European recession.</p>
